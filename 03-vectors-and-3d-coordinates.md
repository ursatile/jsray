To start building a ray tracer, we need a system for modelling three-dimensional space. 

Now, this is where the maths starts to get gnarly. Here's the important part: **you don't need to understand *how* all the stuff here works; it's enough to know *what it does*.** 

We're going to model our world using a 3D coordinate system, based on something called a **vector**.  

A vector is a set of three values *x, y, z*.

> It's conventional to write vectors surrounded with angle brackets, like this: `<3,4,5>`
>
> We'll use this convention in the handbook, but in HTML, angle brackets are used to enclose tags, and in JavaScript, they're less than / greater than, so you won't see angle brackets used like this anywhere in the actual code.

The vector `<0,0,0>` is the **origin** - the centre of our universe. 

Assuming we are standing at the origin, looking in the positive-Z direction:

* The X-axis goes from left (negative) to right (positive)
* The Y-axis runs from underground (negative) towards the sky (positive)
* The Z-axis starts behind us (negative) and runs directly away from us (positive)

We're going to create a JavaScript **module** called `vector.js`, which exports a class called `Vector` that we can then import into the other bits of our project as needed. If you've worked with vectors before, you'll probably recognise things like the dot-product and cross-product. If not, don't worry; we'll explain what it all does as we go along:

```javascript
// modules/vector.js

{% include_relative jstracer-part01/jstracer/modules/vector.js %}
```

Things to note here:

* The coordinate values `x,y,z` are stored using **private properties**. These are a relatively recent addition to JavaScript; any field prefixed with `#` is private, and can't be manipulated from outside the object. By using private properties, we can make our vectors **immutable** -- once a vector has been constructed, you can't change the `x,y,z` values of that vector. 

* New vectors are constructed by specifying the *x,y,z* coordinates of the vector: 

  `let v = new Vector(0,1,0)`

* Every vector has a **length** (also known as the *magnitude*). Because vectors are immutable, we calculate the length in the constructor and store it as part of the vector, since we know it can't change.

* A **unit vector** is a vector with a length of exactly 1 unit. The three most common unit vectors are defined as `static` properties on the `Vector` class:

  `Vector.X`
  `Vector.Y`
  `Vector.Z`

  There's also a static vector for `<0,0,0>` called `O` - that's a letter O, not the number 0:

  `Vector.O`

`Vector` provides methods for various mathematical operations we'll need. Again, don't worry too much about exactly what these do; we're here to draw pictures, not learn vector arithmetic. ðŸ˜‰

* `v1.dot(v2)` returns the **dot product** of vectors `v1` and `v2`
* `v1.cross(v2)` returns the **cross product** of vectors `v1` and `v2`
* `v1.invert()` returns a new vector which is the inverse vector of `v1`. 
* The inverse of `<x,y,z>` is `<-x,-y,-z>`
* `v1.add(v2)` returns the **sum** of vectors `v1` and `v2`
* The sum of a vector and its inverse is always `<0,0,0>`
* `v1.scale(factor)` scales the vector by the specified factor.

## Review & Recap

* The `canvas` element and API give us a way to draw graphics using JavaScript
* To draw graphics, we need to get a **graphics context** for our canvas element.
* We control the color we're drawing by setting the context's`fillStyle` to an HTML color value.
* We can draw individual pixels by using the `fillRect` method and specifying a width and height of ` pixel.
